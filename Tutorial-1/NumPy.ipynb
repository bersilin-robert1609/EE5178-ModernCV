On the other hand, numpy arrays are typed, where the default type is floating point. Because of this, the system knows how much memory to allocate, and if you ask for an array of size 100, it will allocate one hundred contiguous spots in memory, where the size of each spot is based on the type. This makes access extremely fast.\n",
